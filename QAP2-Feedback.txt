S3 Database QAP 2
Author: Brenda Armstrong, SD10
Date: Thursday, May 30, 2024

1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
>> I started my QAP the day that it was released (early).  In Part 1 I completed all (5) of the exercises, it took about 6 hours in total to complete (longer than I anticipated).  Part 2 took me about 2 hours in total.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
>> I used DataCamp cheatsheets and lectures for normalization, I also leveraged AI via ChatGPT.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class persons.)
>> I did not discuss QAP 2 with my classments.

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
>> I asked (1) question to Peter regarding DB and it was to confirm if there was a postgres best practice in choosing varchar or character varying.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you have completed this one.
>> I would rate this a 2/10; I only found it time extensive because I completed all 5 exercises in #1.
